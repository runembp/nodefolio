    <h1>Advanced setup and general use</h1>
    <h4>"use strict", nodemon, let, const</h4>

    <p>To avoid the use of undeclared variables, we can use this command in the top of our app.js file.</p>
    <pre>
        "use strict"
    </pre>

    <p>This ensures that we not able to create variables like this. This will cause an error. We will have to declare it with either let or const instead: </p>

    <pre>
        undeclared_variable = "hello world"
    </pre>

    <p>
        Instead of having to rerun the application every time we have made a change to a file, we can install the dependency nodemon, which is a script that monitors
        changes in our project. Everytime it detects a change, it restarts our application, and since Node is extremely lightweight, the operation barely takes any
        noticable time.<br>
        We install it through the use of either two options - installing it in our local package.json as a dependency, or we use a terminal command to
        install it globally.
    </p>
    <pre>
        package.json:
        {
            "dependencies": {
                "express": "^4.17.1",
                "nodemon": "^2.0.13"
            }
        }
        OR commandline:
            npm install --global nodemon
    </pre>

    <p>
        Now we can simply run nodemon almost as we would run it normally, just with the nodemon command instead. Notice that I have included the .cmd extension, as
        there might be some slight variations on how to run it. In Windows, the .cmd extension is needed, however in Unix, it is not.
    </p>

    <pre>
        nodemon.cmd app.js
    </pre>
