    <h1>Setting up Node</h1>
    <h4>express, app, listen</h4>
    <p>
        The Node Express module is loaded by using the the built-in "require" function. In this example, we store the module in a const object
        by the name of "express". We then load the express module, by using the express function and store it in a const by the name of "app".
        From now on, we have access to the built in functions express, such as listen(), and get(), put(), post(), patch(), which is covered
        in the following chapter <a href="use/">"Using Node Express"</a>
    </p>
    <pre>
        const express = require("express")
        const app = express()
    </pre>

    <p>
        To have an absolutely barebones app running, we still need to tell express which port it needs to listen on. This is made possible through
        the built-in function listen(), which recieves a port number as the first parameter.
    </p>
    <pre>
        app.listen(8080)
    </pre>

    <p>The app can now be run with the terminal command</p>
    <pre>
        node app.js
    </pre>

    <p>And we will be able to access it on http://localhost:8080</p>
